	* util.c: don't provide signal() since we use sigcompat.c

	* Makefile.in: added a build target.

	* var.c (Var_Parse): added ODE modifiers :U, :D, :L, :P, :@ and :!
	These allow some quite clever magic.

	* main.c (main): added support for getenv(MAKESYSPATH).

	* Disable $PWD overriding getcwd() if MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX is set.
	This avoids objdir having a different value depending on how a
	directory was reached (via command line, or subdir.mk).

	* If FORCE_MACHINE is defined, ignore getenv("MACHINE").

	* Do a chdir(${.CURDIR}) before invoking ${.MAKE} or ${.MAKE:T} if
	MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX is set and NOCHECKMAKECHDIR is not.
	I've been testing this in NetBSD's make for some weeks.

	* Turn Makefile into Makefile.in and make it useful.

	* Imported NetBSD's -current make(1) and resolve conflicts.
	
	* Applied autoconf patches from bmake v2

	* Imported clean code base from NetBSD-1.0
